# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dynamic Rotation Compiler is a World of Warcraft addon that enables players to create, manage, and execute complex rotations through a modern, intuitive interface. The addon provides an advanced macro compilation system that allows players to chain multiple abilities into Rotations while maintaining full compliance with Blizzard's Terms of Service and protected environment rules. The system operates on the principle of "one button press equals one action" and uses secure execution methods to ensure all actions are player-initiated.

## Glossary

- **DRC_System**: The main addon system that manages macro creation, storage, and execution
- **Rotation**: An ordered list of WoW macro commands that execute one step per button press
- **Secure_Button**: A Blizzard-provided UI element that can execute protected actions when clicked by the player
- **Protected_Action**: Game actions like casting spells or using items that require hardware input events
- **Ace3_Framework**: The standard addon development framework providing UI, configuration, and data management libraries
- **Blizzard_Compliance**: Adherence to Blizzard's Terms of Service and API usage rules for addon development

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a WoW player, I want to create custom rotations, so that I can execute complex rotations with simplified input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player opens the addon interface, THE DRC_System SHALL display a Rotation creation dialog
2. WHILE creating a Rotation, THE DRC_System SHALL validate each macro command for syntax correctness
3. THE DRC_System SHALL store Rotations using the AceDB-3.0 library with profile support in JSON or YAML format
4. WHERE the player provides a Rotation name, THE DRC_System SHALL ensure unique naming within the current profile
5. IF a Rotation contains invalid macro syntax, THEN THE DRC_System SHALL display specific error messages with line numbers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a WoW player, I want to execute rotations with single button presses, so that I can perform complex rotations efficiently while staying compliant with game rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player clicks a Rotation button, THE DRC_System SHALL execute exactly one macro command from the current Rotation position
2. WHILE in combat, THE DRC_System SHALL only execute pre-configured Secure_Button actions
3. THE DRC_System SHALL advance to the next Rotation step after each successful button press
4. IF a macro command fails to execute, THEN THE DRC_System SHALL advance to the next step on the subsequent button press
5. WHEN a Rotation reaches its end, THE DRC_System SHALL restart from the beginning on the next button press

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a WoW player, I want a modern interface for managing my Rotations, so that I can easily organize and configure my macros.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DRC_System SHALL provide a main interface using AceGUI-3.0 widgets with Blizzard's native styling
2. WHEN the player opens the interface, THE DRC_System SHALL display a list of all saved Rotations
3. WHILE viewing Rotations, THE DRC_System SHALL provide options to create, edit, delete, and duplicate Rotations
4. THE DRC_System SHALL integrate with Blizzard's Interface Options panel using AceConfig-3.0
5. WHERE the player has multiple characters, THE DRC_System SHALL support per-character and global Rotation profiles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a WoW player, I want to import and export Rotations, so that I can share macros with other players and backup my configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DRC_System SHALL provide an export function that generates compressed text strings for Rotations in JSON or YAML format
2. WHEN exporting a Rotation, THE DRC_System SHALL use LibCompress for data compression with JSON or YAML serialization
3. THE DRC_System SHALL provide an import function that accepts compressed Rotation strings
4. IF an imported Rotation has an invalid format, THEN THE DRC_System SHALL display descriptive error messages
5. WHILE importing Rotations, THE DRC_System SHALL validate all macro commands before saving

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a WoW addon developer, I want the system to maintain Blizzard_Compliance, so that the addon remains within Blizzard's Terms of Service and continues to function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DRC_System SHALL ensure each button press triggers at most one Protected_Action
2. WHILE in combat, THE DRC_System SHALL not modify Rotation logic or Secure_Button configurations  
3. THE DRC_System SHALL use only Blizzard-approved APIs for all Protected_Action execution
4. THE DRC_System SHALL not implement any autonomous decision-making or AI-driven ability selection
5. WHEN setting up Rotations, THE DRC_System SHALL configure all Secure_Button attributes before combat begins
